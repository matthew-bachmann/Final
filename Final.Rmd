### Instructions

+ This is the take home midterm due on Wednesday, May 8, at 5:00 pm.

+ There are 30 possible points on this assignment.

+ This midterm should take you 3-4 hours to complete. Do NOT exceed 8 hours of working on the exam. You may work on the exam at various points between now and the due date but the total time cannot exceed 8 hours. 

+ **Rules:**

  - You are allowed to use any course materials on the final. This includes the course texts, previous worksheets, and previous labs.

  - You should not be using google or any other website at any point during this exam. 
  - If you are having trouble using `R` (graphing, for example), look through old worksheets and labs for example code. You will not be asked to do anything in `R` that you have not done before. 
  - You are not permitted to speak with any one other than me about the midterm till after the due date. (Even if you finish early, don't talk to your class mates about it since they might not be finished).
  - Please attempt the exam early so that we can fix any knitting issues before the due date. Your final will not be accepted if it does not knit.

+ Answer `R` questions by writing code where you are asked to `## insert code here`
+ Answer written questions in the space provided where it says "Write your answer here".
+ All answers have a code chunk section but you may not always need to use the code chunks. 
+ **Written answers need to be in complete sentences.**
+ **You need to show your work or `R` code for any calculations.**

#### **TIP 1:** Don't forget to verify the conditions needed to apply our methods to any applicable problems!

#### **TIP 2:** Show lots of work and explain what you are doing in your code. I can give more partial credit if you have the right idea even if the code is not correct.

##### **Exercise 1. For each of the followign statements indicate if they are true or false (no explanation necessary). (2.5 points)** 

**(A.) the $p$-value is the probability of a type I error.**

**(B.) the $p$-value is a measure of how extreme the observed data is.**

**(C.) a $p$-value smaller than the significance level confirms that the null hypothesis is false.**

**(D.) If the null hypothesis is true, then the $p$-value will always be larger than the significance level.**

**(E.) A large $p$-value confirms the null hypothesis.**

##### **Exercise 2. It is claimed that a bag of skittles should contain $30 %$ red, $20 %$ green, $20 %$ orange, $15 %$ yellow, and $15 %$ purple. A quality control analyst wants to test if skittle bags are following this guideline. The analyst randomly selects $20$ bags each containing $50$ skittles so that they have $1000$ skittles in total. From the $1000$ skittles she finds the values in the table below.   (3 points)**

|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Observed | $300$ | $190$ | $185$ | $160$ | $165$ |

**(A.) State the null and alternate hypothesis being tested in this scenario**

$H_0:$

$H_A:$

**(B.) Find the p-value for the test statistic or state why our methods do not apply.**

```{r}
# insert code here
```


**(C.) Use your the p-value to from a conclusion at the $.05$ significance level. Write your conclusion within the context of the problem.**

##### **Exercise 6. Suppose you conduct a hypothesis test with a sample size of $40$ and get a $p$-value of $0.12$. When double checking your work you realize that you made a silly mistake and the sample size was actually $400$. Will your $p$-value increase, decrease, or stay the same? Explain your reasoning.
